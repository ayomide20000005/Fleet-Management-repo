# Fleet Management

This project transforms raw logistics data into actionable insights for a fleet management company struggling with delivery delays, rising costs, and safety violations. Using Excel and SQL, I cleaned and structured shipment data, creating dimension tables and calculating key metrics like on-time delivery rates, safety compliance, fleet efficiency, and utilization. Statistical analysis in KNIME identified late delivery risk factors through logistic regression and regional performance gaps via ANOVA. The final deliverable is an interactive Power BI dashboard with three focused pages: executive KPI overview with geographic mapping, operations deep-dive showing inefficiencies, and fleet performance scorecards highlighting problem areas. This end-to-end project demonstrates data cleaning, database design, predictive analytics, and visual storytelling to solve real business problems.
